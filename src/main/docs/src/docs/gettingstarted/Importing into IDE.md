<h1> Importing a LibGDX project </h1>

Importing projects into your IDE should be painless if setup correctly.

<div class="well info">
    <strong>
    It is highly recommended that you use the Intellij IDE.
    </strong>
</div>

- [Importing into Intellij/Android Studio](#intellij)
- [Importing into Eclipse](#eclipse)
- [Importing into Neatbeans](#netbeans)


<br>

## Intellij

- File > Open > ProjectRoot/build.gradle
- Select OK on the 'Import Project from Gradle dialog'
- Import all modules
- Make sure that <strong>configure on demand</strong> is disabled in your IDEA/AS (File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Gradle-Android Compiler > Configure on demand)

<div class="well error">
If you have any issues when importing, resolve these before continuing!
</div>

Once the project has imported you should run a Gradle sync in the IDE to make sure everything is OK.
To do this you bring up the Gradle tool window (View > Tool windows > Gradle), and hit the sync button, which is in the top left of the 
Gradle tool window.

If this succeeds, you are all imported and ready to get developing.

<br>

## Eclipse

- File > Import > Gradle.  As shown below

![eclipseimport](../../img/docs/eclipseimport.png)


<div class="well error">
If you don't have this import setting available, <strong>stop</strong> and make sure you install BuildShip from eclipse before continuing.
</div>

- Select project root directory, hit finish.

<div class="well error">
If you have any issues when importing, resolve these before continuing!
</div>

## Netbeans

- File > Open Project > Select the project as shown below

![netbeansimport](../../img/docs/netbeansimport.png)

- Wait for the project to fully load and configure.
